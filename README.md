This is a demonstration of KDAlloc for ISSTA 2023. It uses [KDAlloc](https://github.com/srg-imperial/kdalloc-issta-2023) in various configurations on a few examples.

To run the examples, use the [devcontainer](.devcontainer) setup to easily get up and running. The easiest way of doing so is opening this repository in vscode, and letting it create the devcontainer. The examples can then be run in VSCode's integrated terminal.

You may wish to run `ulimit -c 0` before running the examples, as some of them crash the process (e.g., by failing an assertion), which may take longer than expected when kdalloc is enabled due to core dump generation.

Note that some of the examples need to be executed in order (e.g., replay cannot happen w/o a fitting `klee-last` directory generated by a _matching_ KLEE command beforehand).
